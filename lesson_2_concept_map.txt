Concept Map: init, add, staging area
Weâ€™ve introduced a few new concepts since we last revisited our concept map.

git log ...  gives the history of commits
git checkout
git reflog ... reflects back on previous master after having checked out a previous commit


git init
git add
git reset
git status
git diff ... shows difference between files or commits
git diff shows diff btwn similar files in working directory and staging area
git diff --staged shows diff btwen similar files in staging area and repo file
staging area
working directory

git commit
git checkout -b 'new branch name' ... accomplishes both of the following at the same time.
    git branch '(new) branch name' ...  is a label
    git checkout 'branch' ... places you at the head of the branch you're asking for
git log --graph --oneline ... shows a diagram of the commit history, (including particular branches?)
git merge branch1 branch2
git show 'commit' ... shows the change associated wtih the commit given, if no commit given, will show the last commit
