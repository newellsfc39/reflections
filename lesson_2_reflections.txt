What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it? 
a hidden folder ".git" is created that will track the history of the files. ie., their changes.  Otherwise, 
data could be lost for my work and for the work of others.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging directory is an intermediate/holding area between the w.d. and the repo.  It provides a place to keep
your files which have been altered/changed and deemed ready for committing to the repo, while not fully committing
them yet.  Kinda a place to hold files and the changes that you want to keep, but are not done with yet or have
yet to complete other files that will join this/these particular file(s).
